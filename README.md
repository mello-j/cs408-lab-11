Module 11: Lab 11.2

# Project Description
In this project we built a very simple inventory app. This app demonstrated the use of a serverless website,using AWS to implement our backend. This was simply a continuation of the prior lab with a visual component. XML requests were used instead of fetch to put, get, and delete data. Data was returned and displayed dynamically on a web page, and also allowed for user submitted data to be added.

## Running the Website

1. To run everything you will need to Fork or Clone this repository and open in up in an IDE on your local PC or in VS Codespaces.

2. Once you have cloned the Repo, open it up in VS Code.

3. Select the index.html file from the Explorer Window.

4. Then, using the VS Code Command Palette, type: > Live Preview Start Server. If this command is not available, you may need to install the VS Code Live Preview extension.

5. This will open up a website preview within your IDE. You can also open this in an external browser if you choose, by clicking on the 3 horizontal lines icon to the top right of the preview window and selecting 'Open in Browser'.

6. Load table data to see what currently exists in the inventory app

7. Delete table data and watch the table update.

8. Add your own data to the inventory app to see the table update.

9. Addionally you can open your developer tool pane within a Chrome browser, and check the console to see the confirmation messages when items are loaded, added, or deleted.
